Assign Project 01 (one-on-one teaching observation)
* Have you scheduled your observation with your instructor?


Practicing 1-on-1 explanations 

# Flashcard Topics

* Explain the different uses of const in C++
* How do I define a Python function?
* What is all this unit testing stuff?

* How can I access a private member variable in a member function? Don't I need to declare it?
* Why would a function be void?
* Why do I need to compile my code everytime?
* What is the difference between .h and .cpp files

The two main goals for this session are:
* practice explaining concepts clearly and concisely
* explore important elements of your interaction with the student 
(there are many dimensions to this, we will explore how to engage with students and promote discussion using a few techniques)

To practice, we will play a game with flash cards
* Break into small groups
* Select a concept from the flashcards
* Individuals take turn explaining the same concept to the rest of the group - the goal is to be concise, clear, and improve on the explanations heard so far, while trying different variations.
* Play a few rounds until the group is fluent in explaining the concepts on the flash cards
