Assign Project 01 (one-on-one teaching observation)
* Have you scheduled your observation with your instructor?


Practicing 1-on-1 explanations 

# Flashcard Topics

* Explain the different uses of const in C++
* How do I define a Python function?
* What is all this unit testing stuff?
* Explain return vs. print
* Explain the git workflow add/commit/push
* Why use git at all?
* Explain C++ pointers
* Explain recursion
* Help - I don't understand all that command line stuff
* How do Makefiles work?
* What are .o files?
* Explain  member functions and variables in C++ 
* Explain the use of . vs ->
* Re-explain reference vs de-referencing (& vs * ) and different use cases
* How can I access a private member variable in a member function? Don't I need to declare it?
* Why would a function be void?
* Why do I need to compile my code everytime?
* What is the difference between .h and .cpp files

# Tips for promoting discussion

* Get on the same page: Ask: Ahat is the goal?
* Start with a common experience or an analogy
* Rephrase the question (specially if the question is unclear)
* Start by asking a question to contexualize their question
* Ask the student a question during your explanation, phrase your question as "How does the idea that ______ apply to ______ ?
* Ask the student a question during your explanation, phrase your question as "How does the idea that _______ apply to ______ ?
* Ask the student to describe their problem using a diagram
* Visualize the problem for the student on the whiteboard
* Express your own curiosity - say "what if ....", wonder
* Start your explanation with an example problem
* Ask a question to clarify the problem
* Reduce the embarrassment of giving a wrong answer: Ask general questions such as "How do you feel about this?" or "How does this look to you?
* Be sensitive to confusion - pause if you feel the student is lost and allow the student to speak
* Build on the other's response to increase their motivation rather than correct or reprimand.


The two main goals for this session are:
* practice explaining concepts in different ways
* explore important elements of one-on-one interaction with student 
(we will specifically focus on how to engage with students and promote discussion using a few techniques)


To practice, we will play a game with flash cards
* Break into small group
* Individuals take turns explaining the same concept to one other person in the group
* In the first round focus on explaining the same problem in different ways. Observe others and take notes about their explanation.
* In the second round, repeat the same process as before and with the same topic. The person explaining a concept should additionally pick a "Tip card" and try to incorporate the tip in their interaction. 
* Debrief

# Scenarios to contextualize questions

We will wrap up the class with a debrief. Students will also be asked to provide a context for each of the questions on the flashcards. We'll use these scenarios in our activities for next class.
